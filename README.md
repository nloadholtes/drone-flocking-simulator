I read an [article]([url](https://nautil.us/how-to-solve-the-drone-traffic-problem-779798/)) about using the ideas around how birds fly in flocks to help with drone congestion.

This is a really interesting idea: If the drone is semi autonomous it needs to be able to make a "smart" decision probably faster than a human (or centralized control system) could.

I decided to explore this problem with some help from claude.ai, so I described the problem and let it produce the framework.
